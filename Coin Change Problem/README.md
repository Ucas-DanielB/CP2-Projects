# Coin Change Problem

## Overview
---
This program calculates the minimum number of coins needed to make a given amount using coin denominations from different countries. It reads coin values from a CSV file and provides an optimal solution. The user selects a country, enters a target amount, and the program outputs the fewest coins required to make that amount along with a breakdown of the coins used.

## How to Run
1. Run `main.py`
2. Enter a country (USA, UK, Canada, Euro)
3. Enter a target amount (in cents)
4. See the minimum number of coins needed

## Installation
1. Clone the repository or open the folder
2. Ensure you have Python installed
3. Install necessary extensions

## Execution and Usage
- Select a country (USA, UK, Canada, Euro's/European)
- Enter a valid target amount
- REceive the minimum number of coins needed and the coin breakdown.

## Used Technologies
Pandas:
- pip install pandas
NumPy:
- pip install numpy

## Current Features
1. Reads coin denominations from a CSV file based on the selected country.
2. Implements an optimized algorithm to find the minimum number of coins
3. Provides detailed error handling for missing files and invalid inputs.
